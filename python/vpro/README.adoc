= Scripts to check to entire content of sitemap at various VPRO sites with the content of the 'pages' api.

Useage

Do all checks

[source,bash]
----
make all
----

Check only vpro
[source,bash]
----
make vpro
----

Correct all differences for vpro:
[source,bash]
----
make vpro resolve=true
----
For this to work you need to tunnel JMX to os2-magnolia-backend-prod-01 on localhost:5000

It will also ask for credentials to the page publisher API if it hasn't done so before. Use vpro-cms user from 1password.

The makefile is basically a wrapper around the python script `check_with_sitemap_vpro.py` which depends on the
https://github.com/npo-poms/pyapi[python api]. Run the script in the necessary python environment as described there.
